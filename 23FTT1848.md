# Git


## Install git

if not sure whether Git is install or not. u can try the command below on your local terminal;
```
 $git --version
```
Below is what u should be expecting to have

```
PS C:\Users\Vero> git --version
git version 2.47.1.windows.1
```

if Git is not install, go to their official website. Download the file according to ur os system. Open the .exe file to install. Congratulation u have git install 

--------------

## Configuration of Git

The reason why we need this, is to tell who you are when push or pull so it will be save under the registered name and email 

This is the command for registering
```
$git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
```
if wanting to check the current name & email just retype the command but without putting the name and email eg.
``` 
$git config --global user.email //to check the current use email
```
below are how u would expect when checking;
```
PS C:\Users\Vero> git config --global user.name
Zaki Harith
PS C:\Users\Vero> git config --global user.email
23FTT1848@student.pb.edu.bn
```

**Important Note: Please take note who and what name & email is currently using, this is to ensure future use so it would not clash with other name & email that you are using**

-----------------------

## Create a repository
 

make a new folder command 
```
$mkdir "name of folder"
```
opening a folder command
``` 
$cd "name of folder"
```
*important part*
initialize git in current folder 
```
$git init
```
*current folder being used is "NetPro-AS01"*

*u can use:
```
 $code . 
```
 - to open the current folder with Visual Studio for conveniency

### NANO
in the real practical we will be using NANO instead of Vs code to edit the file 

GO to window search bar and search for "Git bash" . Then, press enter. make sure u r are on/in the right folder 
Type the following command to use git bash
```
$nano filename
```

- Press ctrl+o to save 
- Press ctrl+x to exit 
---------------------

## Create new file
================
it depend on the user how/where/what they want to create a file, by using Visual Studio app also can. but u can also use the command below to create a file inside of the git bash.
``` 
$touch filename.md 
```
There a lots of ways to delete a file but the esiest one is by 
```
$Remove-Item "filename.txt"
```
but if you want to delete all file by type u can use it like this 
```
$Remove-Item *.txt 
```

u also can use *.md to delete all .md file.


## Check status,add,commit changes


check status of current folder by using 
```
$git status
```
Below are some of the expected outcome since nothing happen yet 
```
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        md-logbook.md
        txt-logbook.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```
Saving(add) file to git by
```
$git add filename.txt
``` 

**Now onto next step** 
```
$git commit -m "any message"
```
 - This is to committing the changes and leave some message to tell the update
```
[master (root-commit) 9a37f8f] Created a new file
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 txt-logbook.txt
``` 
- Above will be the output in the terminal

*Comparing cmd*
```
$git diff
```
 - To tell the different between before and after if there's any changes in the file . "Pretty straight forward"
  
------------------------------------

## Add GitHub username to git 

```
#This cmd can register or change the current user 
$git config --global user.username <USerNamE> 

#To check the current user
$git config --global user.username 
```
 - lets not be confuse here above its says user.username and not user.name
to make it clear;
``` 
my user.name = Zaki Harith
my user.username = ZakiHarith 
```
*Noting this down is a power move to reduce confusion and conflicts of current used name*
-----------------------------

## Create remote repository

```
Go to GitHub > repository > create new that match your local file name if u have one alredy. that's all. 
```
*u can make repo and a readme.file from the get go , this procedure will omit some of the part for conveniency*
-------------------------

## Connect local to remote

```
go to GitHub > go to repo that u made, click copy url from quick setup.
```
- note down the urls
```
#To add remote origin in our repo
$git remote add origin <URLFROMGITHUB> 
```
- URLs = https://github.com/ZakiHarith/git-logbook-pratice.git
  
or 
```
#This cmd is for if GitHub app is install on your desktop
$git remote set-url origin <URLFROMGITHUB> 
```
*Key thing to note here: The remote name is "origin" . Bear that in mind*
------------------------

## Push work to remote 

To push(send) everything what we done just use 
```
"$git push origin master"
```
- *keynote to take is that "origin" is our current remote name, and "master" is our current branch named*
```
remote name=origin
branch name=master
```

This is the expected output from the terminal:
```
PS C:\Users\Vero\git-logbook-pratice> git push origin master
Enumerating objects: 11, done.
Counting objects: 100% (11/11), done.
Delta compression using up to 12 threads

 * [new branch]      master -> master
```
-------------------

## Pull work from remoet to desktop

use the following command:
```
$ git pull <REMOTENAME> <BRANCHNAME>
```

# Python 

---------


# Django



## Initialising 


First we need to make a folder so it easier to remember where to put or access whatever project we install in it 

```
$mkdir filename
```
- a cmd to make a folder 

now we go onto the file that we make by using:
```
#open a file 
$cd filename

#go out of file 
$cd ..
```
--------------
  
## Installing django 


First we can check whether we have Django or not 
```
$python -m django --version
```
- if a version of django is listed thts mean django is already install if not continue to the next step 

now we make a folder to store django 
```
$mkdir djangotutorial
```
- here I rename the file as djangotutorial so i know where i put my django stuff incase we install venv(virtual machine) in the same project folder 
```
$ls
```
- this is to list out what is inside of the current folder 
-below is some of of the result of using $ls
```
 Directory: C:\Users\Vero\djgotest


Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
d-----          2/9/2025   9:18 PM                djangotutorial
```

now run:

```
$django-admin startproject mysite djangotutorial
```
- This will create a mysite project from django 

after opening the djangotutorial folder and $ls below output would be expected  
```
 Directory: C:\Users\Vero\djgotest\djangotutorial


Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
d-----          2/9/2025   9:19 PM                mysite
-a----          2/9/2025   9:19 PM            684 manage.py
```
--------------------

## Running Django server 

After the step above, run the following cmd:

```
$ python manage.py runserver
```
- this cmd will run django server 

```

## self study ##
in the first tutorial are using the cmd:'django-admin startproject mysite djangotutorial'
```
PS C:\Users\Vero\project> django-admin startproject mysite djangotutorial
django-admin : The term 'django-admin' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable
program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.

------------

## Day 4 

***DONT SHARE THE SSH KEY**
++learning of ssh key or PKI++ 
ssh key is a key if you dont want to use a password 
***WARNING THIS SSH KEY IS FOR THIS PC** - "So dont share"

**Steps**
1st-open terminal

2nd-enter "ssh-key" to generate a ssh key

**important note** For a personal computer just omit it because it is cumbersome it work like a two authenticate as in the ssh key as a password and the passphrase is the 2nd authentication  

++checking if the server is up or not++
'ping ip (address)'
- to check if the ip is up 

++To authenticate your server++

'ssh-root2@(nameofserver)'

to open inside of name's server

---------

## Day (dont remember when)

 install Django notes  

++First we make a folder to store Django++
but before that we need to make a virtual machine first 
"python -m venv tutorial-env"
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unretricted -Scope Process
if the window issues of being restricted run "Set-ExecutionPolicy Unretricted -Scope Process"

tutorial-env\Scripts\activate
mkdir djangotutorial
django-admin startproject mysite djangotutorial
"code ." / this is just to check the file or preview the file 

to run the Django server inside of the folder
"python manage.py runserver"

after the completion of server now can proceed to polls 

after that run "python manage.py startapp polls"
//it will create a polls file and so on

now use "code ." to preview all the current file 

NOW the coding part 

open the polls/view.py
copy paste the code:
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
from django.http import HttpResponse


def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, world. You're at the polls index.")
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

open the polls/urls.py 
copy past the code
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
from django.urls import path

from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path("", views.index, name="index"),
]
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

make a mysite/urls.py file 
copy paste the code:
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
    path("polls/", include("polls.urls")),
    path("admin/", admin.site.urls),
]
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

##Install git
==============
if not sure whether Git is install or not. u can try the command below on your local terminal;
```
 $git --version
```
Below is what u should be expecting to have

```
PS C:\Users\Vero> git --version
git version 2.47.1.windows.1
```

if Git is not install, go to their official website. Download the file according to ur os system. Open the .exe file to install. Congratulation u have git install 

--------------

##Configuration of Git
=======================
The reason why we need this, is to tell who you are when push or pull so it will be save under the registered name and email 

This is the command for registering
```
$git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
```
if wanting to check the current name & email just retype the command but without putting the name and email eg.
``` 
$git config --global user.email //to check the current use email
```
below are how u would expect when checking;
```
PS C:\Users\Vero> git config --global user.name
Zaki Harith
PS C:\Users\Vero> git config --global user.email
23FTT1848@student.pb.edu.bn
```

**Important Note: Please take note who and what name & email is currently using, this is to ensure future use so it would not clash with other name & email that you are using**

-----------------------

##Create a repository
===================== 

make a new folder command 
```
$mkdir "name of folder"
```
opening a folder command
``` 
$cd "name of folder"
```
*important part*
initialize git in current folder 
```
$git init
```
*current folder being used is "NetPro-AS01"*
```
*u can use "$code ." //to open the current folder with Visual Studio*
```

---------------------

##Create new file
================
it depend on the user how/where/what they want to create a file, by using Visual Studio app also can. but u can also use the command below to create a file inside of the git bash.
``` 
$touch filename.md 
```
There a lots of ways to delete a file but the esiest one is by 
```
$Remove-Item "filename.txt"
```
but if you want to delete all file by type u can use it like this 
```
$Remove-Item *.txt 
```

u also can use *.md to delete all .md file.


##Check status,add,commit changes
================

check status of current folder by using 
```
$git status
```
Below are some of the expected outcome since nothing happen yet 
```
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        md-logbook.md
        txt-logbook.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```
Saving(add) file to git by
```
$git add filename.txt
``` 

**Now onto next step** 
```
$git commit -m "any message"
```
 - This is to committing the changes and leave some message to tell the update
```
[master (root-commit) 9a37f8f] Created a new file
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 txt-logbook.txt
``` 
- Above will be the output in the terminal

*Comparing cmd*
```
$git diff
```
 - To tell the different between before and after if there's any changes in the file . "Pretty straight forward"
  
------------------------------------

##Add GitHub username to git 
===========================
```
#This cmd can register or change the current user 
$git config --global user.username <USerNamE> 

#To check the current user
$git config --global user.username 
```
 - lets not be confuse here above its says user.username and not user.name
to make it clear;
``` 
my user.name = Zaki Harith
my user.username = ZakiHarith 
```
*Noting this down is a power move to reduce confusion and conflicts of current used name*
-----------------------------

##Create remote repository
=========================
```
Go to GitHub > repository > create new that match your local file name if u have one alredy. that's all. 
```
*u can make repo and a readme.file from the get go , this procedure will omit some of the part for conveniency*
-------------------------

##Connect local to remote
========================
```
go to GitHub > go to repo that u made, click copy url from quick setup.
```
- note down the urls
```
#To add remote origin in our repo
$git remote add origin <URLFROMGITHUB> 
```
- URLs = https://github.com/ZakiHarith/git-logbook-pratice.git
  
or 
```
#This cmd is for if GitHub app is install on your desktop
$git remote set-url origin <URLFROMGITHUB> 
```
*Key thing to note here: The remote name is "origin" . Bear that in mind*
------------------------

##Push work to remote 
===================
To push(send) everything what we done just use 
```
"$git push origin master"
```
- *keynote to take is that "origin" is our current remote name, and "master" is our current branch named*
```
remote name=origin
branch name=master
```

This is the expected output from the terminal:
```
PS C:\Users\Vero\git-logbook-pratice> git push origin master

##Install git
==============
if not sure whether Git is install or not. u can try the command below on your local terminal;

 $git --version

below is what u should be expecting to have

```
PS C:\Users\Vero> git --version
git version 2.47.1.windows.1
```

if Git is not install, go to their official website. Download the file according to ur os system. Open the .exe file to install. Congratulation u have git install 
--------------

##Configuration of Git
=======================
The reason why we need this, is to tell who you are when push or pull so it will be save under the registered name and email 

```
This is the command for registering
$git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
```
if wanting to check the current name&email just retype the command but without putting the name and email eg. $git config --global user.email to check the current use email
below are how u would expect when checking;
```
PS C:\Users\Vero> git config --global user.name
Zaki Harith
PS C:\Users\Vero> git config --global user.email
23FTT1848@student.pb.edu.bn
```

**please take note who and what name & email is currently using, this is to ensure future use so it would not clash with other name & email that you are using**
-----------------------

##Create a repository
===================== 

make a new folder command 
$mkdir "name of folder"

opening a folder command 
$cd "name of folder"

*important part*
initialize git in current folder 
$git init

*current folder being used is "git-logbook-pratice"*
*u can use "$code ." to open the current folder with Visual Studio*
---------------------

##Create new file
================
it depend on the user how/where/what they want to create a file, by using Visual Studio app also can. but u can also use the command below to create a file inside of the terminal. 
$ //dont knwow the cmd 

there a lots of ways to delete a file but the esiest one is by $Remove-Item "filename.txt"
but if you want to delete all file by type u can use it like this $Remove-Item *.txt then it will delete .txt file in the folder. u can use *.md to delete all .md file.

*i created 2 file here one md-logbook.md and one txt-logbook.txt file for practice purpose*

##Check status,add,commit changes
================
it depend on the user how/where/what they want to create a file, by using Visual Studio app also can. but u can also use the command below to create a file inside of the terminal. 
$

*i created 2 file here one md-logbook.md and one txt-logbook.txt file for practice purpose*

*Check status,add,commit changes*
==================================
check status of current folder by using "$git status"
below are some of the expected outcome since nothing happen yet 
```
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        md-logbook.md
        txt-logbook.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```
saving(add) file to git by "git add filename.txt"

now onto next step 

$git commit -m "Created readme" - this is to committing the changes and leave some message to tell the update
```
[master (root-commit) 9a37f8f] Created a new file
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 txt-logbook.txt
``` 

u can use $git diff to tell the different between before and after if there's any changes in the file pretty straight forward
------------------------------------

onto the next stage

##Add GitHub username to git 
===========================
$git config --global user.username <USerNamE> // this cmd can register or change the current user 
$git config --global user.username //to check the current user

lets not be confuse here above its says user.username and not user.name
to make it clear; 
my user.name = Zaki Harith
my user.username = ZakiHarith 
*noting this down is a power move to reduce confusion and conflicts of current used name*
-----------------------------

##Create remote repository
=========================
go to GitHub > repository > create new that match your local file if u have one alredy. that's all. 
*u can make repo and a readme.file from the get go , this procedure will omit some of the part for conveniency*
-------------------------

##Connect local to remote
========================
go to GitHub > go to repo that u made, click copy url from quick setup.
URLs = https://github.com/ZakiHarith/git-logbook-pratice.git

$git remote add origin <URLFROMGITHUB> //to add remote origin in our repo
or 
$git remote set-url origin <URLFROMGITHUB> //this cmd is for if GitHub app is install on your desktop

*key thing to note here the remote name is origin. bear that in mind*
------------------------

##Push work to remote 
===================
to push(send) everything what we done just use $git push origin master
*keynote to take is that "origin" is our current remote name, and "master" is our current branch named
remote name=origin
branch name=master*
